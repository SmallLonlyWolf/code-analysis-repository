A Repository for Testing Code-Analysis Tools.
This project includes many code examples (C/C++ to begin with) for typical violation of coding-standards (e.g. MISRA-C, JSF etc) or typical programming bugs.
This code may be used to check and compare static and dynamic analysis tools (e.g. QAC, Klocwork, LDRA, C++Test, Code-Sonar, Coverity, Lint, PolySpace, Insure++, DevPartner).
